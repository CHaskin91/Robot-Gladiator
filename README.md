## Lesson 1
* Learned about the role JavaScript plays in web development.
* Interacted with the player via dialog windows using built-in browser functions.
* Created our own JavaScript functions to execute actions.
* Stored and manipulated data, and learned about data types we can store using JavaScript variables.
* Monitored whether our code was working by using the Chrome DevTools Console.
* Created JavaScript control flow statements to run blocks of code based on the current state of our data.

## Lesson 2
* Learned some of the basic building blocks of JavaScript and how to implement them in an application.
* Pseudocoded as the first step to start thinking about how to code.
* Stored and accessed data at numeric indexes by using arrays.
* Used "for" and "while" loops to allow blocks of code to execute repeatedly until their conditional statements evaluate to false, which breaks the loop.
* Identified variables at distinct moments of the program's execution by using "console.log" and the "debugger" statement.

## Lesson 3
* Wrote two functions - startGame() and endGame() - to control the flow of the game while keeping the code organized and 'DRY'.
* Used additional confirm(), alert(), and prompt() methods to provide a better user experience.
* Built a new shop feature that can accommodate multiple input options thanks to the 'switch' statement.

## Lesson 4
* Used the built-in "Math.max()" method to prevent values from going negative.
* Generated random numbers with the "Math.random()" method.
* Converted many of our variables into objects to keep player and enemy data coupled together.
* Added methods to our player object to facilitate manipulating players data.

## Lesson 5
* Managed time and focus by tracking bugs and feature requests in GitHub issues.
* Intelligently prioritized GitHub Issues
* Validated player input prior to operating on it.
* Refactored for simplicity and maintainability.
* Used a recursive funciton.
* Distinguished and converted between number and string types.
* Learned how to persist data in the browser by using 'localStorage'.
