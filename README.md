# Robot-Gladiators

## Lesson 1
* Learned about the role JavaScript plays in web development.
* Interacted with the player via dialog windows using built-in browser functions.
* Created our own JavaScript functions to execute actions.
* Stored and manipulated data, and learned about data types we can store using JavaScript variables.
* Monitored whether our code was working by using the Chrome DevTools Console.
* Created JavaScript control flow statements to run blocks of code based on the current state of our data.

## Lesson 2
* Learned some of the basic building blocks of JavaScript and how to implement them in an application.
* Pseudocoded as the first step to start thinking about how to code.
* Stored and accessed data at numeric indexes by using arrays.
* Used "for" and "while" loops to allow blocks of code to execute repeatedly until their conditional statements evaluate to false, which breaks the loop.
* Identified variables at distinct moments of the program's execution by using "console.log" and the "debugger" statement.
